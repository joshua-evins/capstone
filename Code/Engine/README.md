This is my game Engine at the time of my Capstone projects (late 2013). The entirety of this project was developed with minor guidance from my classes (Renderer was particularly unguided) during my second year of programming.

Development of this engine began in February 2013 with 10 weeks dedicated to graphics, 3 to level saving / loading, 2 to AI, and 5 to 2D Physics for a total of 20 weeks of development time before I began using it for the projects in this repository.

The current state of this project is the result of 10 further weeks of development alongside the projects in this repository.
