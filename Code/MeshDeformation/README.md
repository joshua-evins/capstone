This project is the first of my three capstone projects.

I selected this project in particular to drive development of my engine and to test for stability of my Renderer (it was written in 10 weeks after just one year of programming, so I wanted to do some QA).

Demo Controls:
* Press ENTER in the black screen to start
* Hold the right mouse button and move the mouse to rotate the camera
* Standard WASD for camera movement
* R: move straight up
* F: move straight down
* N: new ripple
* M: new wave
* Z: clear effects

The engine has a slight conflict with the 2012 compiler so upgrading that project, which is a requirement of this project, may cause a crash. You can set the compiler for that project to 2010 post-upgrade and it should function properly.

For more detail about the development process of this demo see weeks 2-3 in the [https://github.com/joshua-evins/capstone/blob/master/Documentation/WeeklyProjectSummary.pdf](WeeklyProgressSummary)
